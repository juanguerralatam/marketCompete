Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[William->all]: In looking at both restaurants, I find that American Delight has a higher customer score of 7.09 compared to Lin's USA Diner, which has a score of 5.67. Additionally, the menu at American Delight seems to offer more enticing options for my taste, especially considering my preference for flavorful dishes like the BBQ Chicken Sandwich and the Chipotle Black Bean Burger.

From the comments, American Delight appears to have a more consistent positive feedback regarding its BBQ Chicken Sandwich, which has been described as flavorful and satisfying, while the feedback for Lin's USA Diner indicates that many of their dishes, including the BBQ Chicken Sandwich and Classic Cheeseburger, were considered average or bland.

I believe it would be beneficial to focus on the quality of food and service, which seem to be better at American Delight. I’m leaning towards suggesting we go there for our meal, particularly because of their enticing gourmet options and the generally positive reviews.

What does everyone else think? Shall we discuss our preferences and see if we can come to a consensus?

[Felix->all]: I appreciate your perspective, Dad. I also noticed that American Delight has a significantly higher customer score, which suggests that their food and service may be better overall. The BBQ Chicken Sandwich stands out as a popular choice, and their menu has a variety of interesting options like the Chipotle Black Bean Burger and Gourmet Milkshake that could cater to different tastes.

On the other hand, while Lin's USA Diner has some appealing items, the overall feedback indicates that many dishes fall flat in terms of flavor. As someone who appreciates healthy and flavorful food, I think we would enjoy a more satisfying meal at American Delight.

However, I’d like to hear from Mom and Xavier to see if they have any preferences or insights on the matter. What do you think?

[William->all]: I appreciate the menus of both restaurants, but I must admit that neither of them aligns perfectly with my taste preferences for sushi and Japanese cuisine. However, I will focus on their offerings and service quality.

At "American Delight," the menu features classic American comfort foods like burgers, BBQ ribs, and mac and cheese. While these dishes sound hearty, they lean heavily on rich flavors which may not align with my health-centric preferences.

On the other hand, "American Dream USA" offers a variety of items, including a gourmet burger and a Caesar salad, which could provide a healthier option with the salad. The inclusion of loaded nachos and artisanal fries suggests a more diverse menu, but again, it doesn't cater to my taste for sushi or Japanese cuisine.

Given my reserved personality, I might be more inclined to a restaurant that has a comfortable atmosphere and good service. Since both places lack customer scores, it’s hard to gauge service quality. 

I think I need to discuss further with Paula and possibly get her input on what she might prefer. I’d also like to gauge Felix's opinion, considering our recent conflicts. It could be a good opportunity to ease tensions during the meal. 

Let's see what they think.

[Felix->all]: Thanks for sharing your thoughts, William. I understand your concerns about the menus not catering to your preferences. I personally have a taste for Chinese cuisine, so neither restaurant aligns perfectly with what I enjoy. 

However, looking at the menus, "American Delight" has some classic comfort food that might be appealing in terms of indulgence, with items like the Classic American Burger and BBQ Ribs. That said, it seems quite heavy and not particularly healthy. 

On the other hand, "American Dream USA" offers a wider variety of options that appear to include some healthier choices, especially with the Caesar salad and the gourmet burger, which might be more appealing. The inclusion of items like loaded nachos and artisanal fries also adds a fun element to the menu. 

I’m concerned about the service quality since we have no customer scores to rely on. It might be worthwhile to discuss this further with Paula and Xavier to see if they have any preferences or insights that could help us make a decision. 

Xavier, what are your thoughts?

[Xavier->all]: Thank you, William and Felix, for sharing your insights. I understand that neither restaurant aligns perfectly with our individual tastes, and I appreciate your thoughtful considerations.

For me, as someone who enjoys vibrant Caribbean cuisine, I find that neither menu fully caters to my preferences. However, I can see some appealing aspects in both restaurants. 

At "American Delight," the Classic American Burger and BBQ Ribs sound delicious, but they may not be the healthiest options. The Mac and Cheese is tempting as well, but it's quite heavy. 

On the other hand, "American Dream USA" has some healthier options like the Caesar salad, and the Gourmet Burger seems intriguing with its artisanal toppings. The Loaded Nachos and Buffalo Wings could add a fun element to our meal, too. 

I appreciate the variety at "American Dream USA," which might provide us with a more balanced meal overall. Although neither restaurant is perfect, I believe the diversity in the menu could cater to different preferences among us.

Let's hear Paula's thoughts before we propose a final decision!

[Paula->all]: Thank you for sharing your thoughts, everyone! I see that we all have our individual tastes and preferences, but I appreciate how we’re considering each other’s opinions.

From my perspective, I lean towards "American Dream USA." The menu offers a better balance with options like the Caesar salad, which aligns with my desire for healthier choices. The Gourmet Burger sounds intriguing, and I love the idea of sharing the Loaded Nachos and Buffalo Wings as a fun appetizer. 

While "American Delight" has classic comfort foods, I feel it leans too heavily towards heavy dishes, which might not make for a great dining experience for all of us. Plus, having a more varied menu at "American Dream USA" could help us bridge the gap between our different tastes.

I sense that we might be leaning towards "American Dream USA," but I would love to hear if anyone has any reservations or if we should discuss it further before making a final choice!

[William->all]: [Caesar Salad]: The Caesar Salad was decent but not particularly memorable. The dressing was good, but the overall freshness of the ingredients left something to be desired. I would give it a score of 5 out of 10.

[Loaded Nachos]: The Loaded Nachos were just okay. They had a good amount of toppings, but the chips were a bit soggy. I would rate them a 5 out of 10.

[Buffalo Wings]: The Buffalo Wings were slightly better, with a good amount of spice, but they could have been crispier. I would score them a 6 out of 10.

[Milkshake]: The Milkshake was creamy, but the flavor was not as rich as I expected. I would give it a 6 out of 10.

[Felix]: I agree with William's observations. The Gourmet Burger and the Caesar Salad didn’t meet my expectations, and I think I would rate them both a 5 out of 10 as well. The Loaded Nachos were decent, but like William said, they could have been better. The Buffalo Wings were a highlight for me, so I would rate them a 7 out of 10. The Milkshake was enjoyable but nothing special, so I would give it a 6 out of 10.

[Xavier]: I think we share similar sentiments. I would rate the Gourmet Burger and Caesar Salad the same as you both at 5 out of 10. The Loaded Nachos were average too, so I’d also give them a 5. The Buffalo Wings had a good kick, so I’d rate them a 7 out of 10. The Milkshake was alright, and I’d score it a 6 as well.

[Paula]: I appreciate everyone sharing their thoughts. I feel the same way about the Gourmet Burger and the Caesar Salad. I’d rate them both a 5 out of 10. The Loaded Nachos were okay, so I’d give them a 5 as well. The Buffalo Wings were the best dish so far, so I would give them a 7 out of 10. The Milkshake, while enjoyable, could be better, so I'd rate it a 6 out of 10.

[William]: Based on our scores, it seems we all have a similar perspective on the dishes we ordered. I think we should summarize our experience and scores for a final review.

[Felix->all]: I agree with the overall sentiment shared by everyone. The dishes at "American Dream USA" didn't quite hit the mark for me. The Gourmet Burger and Caesar Salad lacked the excitement I was hoping for, earning a score of 5 from me. The Loaded Nachos were just average, so I would rate them the same. The Buffalo Wings had a good kick, so I would give them a 7 out of 10. As for the Milkshake, it was decent but not memorable, so I’ll give it a 6.

If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant. If you don't make choices, return 'None'>,
    "dishes" : [

    ],
    "summary": <A summary of the group discussion, including why this restaurant was chosen, and how each member's opinion influenced the final decision>
